# Langchain-chatbot
Chatbot Answering from Your Own Knowledge Base: Langchain, ChatGPT, Pinecone, and Streamlit
- In this project we take you through the process of creating a chatbot that leverages the power of Langchain, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Pinecone, and Streamlit Chat. This chatbot not only responds to user queries but also refines queries and pulls information from its own document index, making it incredibly efficient and capable of answering in-depth questions.
- we will be delving into the technicalities of creating a highly efficient chatbot that can answer queries from its own documents or knowledge base. This chatbot, leveraging the power of advanced language models, can also respond to follow-up questions from the users, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.
### Setting Up the Environment
- The requirements.txt file contains a list of libraries and tools required for this project. Here's what it includes:

streamlit: This library helps us to create interactive web apps for machine learning and data science projects.

streamlit_chat: This Streamlit component is used for creating the chatbot user interface.

langchain: This is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

sentence_transformers: This library allows us to use transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa, etc., for generating semantic representations of text (i.e., embeddings), which we'll use for our document indexing.

openai: This is the official OpenAI library that allows us to use their language models, like GPT-3.5-turbo, for generating human-like text.

unstructured and unstructured[local-inference]: These are used for document processing and managing unstructured data.

pinecone-client: This is the client for Pinecone, a vector database service that enables us to perform similarity search on vector data.

### Document Indexing
### Splitting documents
### Creating embeddings
### Storing embeddings in Pinecone
### Building the Chatbot Application with Streamlit
